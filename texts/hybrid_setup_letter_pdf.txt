Subject: Request for Approval of Hybrid Work Setup for Internship/OJT
Dear Dr. Mayling,
I hope you are doing well. I am writing on behalf of our group currently undergoing our
Internship/OJT at Hacienda Darasa Resort & Hotel to formally seek your approval for a
hybrid work setup. The management of Hacienda Darasa has decided that we will
follow a hybrid arrangement, and we would like to request the university’s permission to
proceed accordingly.
The proposed schedule is as follows:
On-Site Work: Monday, Tuesday, and Friday
Work-from-Home: Wednesday and Thursday
This setup will allow us to effectively fulfill our internship tasks while maintaining
productivity in both physical and remote environments. We are committed to ensuring
that all responsibilities are completed efficiently and will remain fully accessible through
the necessary communication and project management tools during our work-from-
home days.
We kindly seek your approval for this arrangement. Please let us know if there are any
requirements or further discussions needed regarding this request. We appreciate your
time and consideration and look forward to your guidance.
Thank you for your support.
Sincerely,
Juan Miguel C. Torres
