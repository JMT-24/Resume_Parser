# Resume Parser (Discontinued) 🚨

## ❌ Project Status: Discontinued
This was my attempt at building a **resume parser** using spaCy. After multiple iterations and fine-tuning, I realized that spaCy **wasn't the best tool** for this problem due to its limitations with structured documents like resumes.

### 🔍 Why I Stopped Working on This Project
- **Resume parsing is more complex than expected** – Resumes come in highly variable formats, making it hard for spaCy’s NER model to generalize well.
- **SpaCy struggled with structured text** – Unlike deep learning models (like BERT or LayoutLM), spaCy does not handle layout-based parsing efficiently.
- **Better alternative projects available** – Instead of forcing spaCy for this task, I decided to shift my focus to a **Sentiment Analysis project**, which is more suitable for spaCy’s capabilities.

### ✅ What I Learned
- **How Named Entity Recognition (NER) works** in spaCy and why training custom models is challenging.
- **Why tool selection matters in NLP** – some problems require more advanced deep learning models instead of rule-based approaches.
- **That pivoting is okay!** Sometimes, abandoning a project is the best learning experience.

## 🗑 Should You Use This Repo?
If you're looking for a **working resume parser**, this is probably **not the best solution**. However, if you're interested in **learning from my mistakes**, feel free to explore the repo and experiment with spaCy’s NER capabilities!
